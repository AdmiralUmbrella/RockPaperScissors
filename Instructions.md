# RockPaperScissors
## This is my final project of choice 

So to summarize, my instructor gave me 5 projects for me to choose. They were arranged from easy to less easy.

- Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Maze
- Connect Four
- Checkers
- Minesweepers

Of course I went with the easy one but now that I finished the Rock-Paper-Scissors, I'm trying to do the others starting with the Maze.
